The logic and algorithms used in the provided Tic Tac Toe game code:

Game Logic Initialization (create_board()):
Initializes a 3x3 NumPy array filled with zeros to represent the game board.

Checking for a Winner (check_winner(board, player)):
Iterates through rows and columns to check if any row, column, or diagonal is completely occupied by the player's moves (player is either 1 or 2).
Uses NumPy functions to efficiently check rows (np.all(board[i, :] == player)), columns (np.all(board[:, i] == player)), and diagonals (np.all(np.diag(board) == player) and np.all(np.diag(np.fliplr(board)) == player)).

Game Evaluation (evaluate(board)):
Checks if either player 1 or player 2 has won using check_winner(board, player).
Returns the player number (1 or 2) if there is a winner, -1 if the game is a draw (board is full), or 0 if the game is ongoing.

Possible Moves (possibilities(board)):
Returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates where the board contains zeros (indicating empty spaces).

Random Move by Computer (random_place(board, player)):
Chooses a random empty space on the board (possibilities(board)) and places the player's move (player is 1 for the human player, 2 for the computer).

GUI Implementation (TicTacToeGUI class):
Uses customtkinter for GUI elements (buttons, labels, option menu).
Initializes game-specific attributes such as player names, victory messages, and images for each player's moves and victory conditions.

Game Flow (make_move(row, col) and computer_move()):

Handles player moves (make_move):
Updates the board with the player's move.
Disables the button corresponding to the move.
Plays a sound (X.mp3 or O.mp3) depending on the player.
Checks for a winner after each move and switches turns.

Handles computer moves (computer_move):
If playing against the computer (self.play_with_computer), initiates a move for player 2 (computer).
Updates the board and disables the corresponding button.
Plays a sound for the computer's move.
Checks for a winner or a draw condition after the move.

Game Outcome Display (show_winner(winner)):
Disables all buttons once the game ends.
Displays a message box with the game outcome (balanced environmental impact for a draw) or creates a new window (Toplevel) to display the winner's message and image.
Resets the game board and current player after displaying the outcome.
Game Initialization and Main Loop (if __name__ == "__main__":):

Initializes the customtkinter application (root) and starts the main event loop (root.mainloop()).
Creates an instance of TicTacToeGUI to start the game.
Overall, the code combines backend game logic using NumPy for board operations with a frontend GUI using customtkinter, offering a playable Tic Tac Toe game with options for human vs. human or human vs. computer gameplay.
